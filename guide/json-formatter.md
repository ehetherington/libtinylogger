# JSON formatter
## JSON Message formatting and output
The format mostly mimics the java.util.logging.XMLFormatter output.

The JSON output is an array of records. The record objects are:

 - `isoDateTime` The message timestamp - it includes UTC offset, and may
                 optionally include timezone. See [enabling timezone]
				 (#enabling-timezone).
 - `timespec`    The struct timespec timestamp (basis of isoDateTime)
   - `sec`
   - `nsec`
 - `sequence`    The sequence number of the message. Starts at 1.
 - `logger`      Always "tinylogger".
 - `file`        `__FILE__` captured by the calling macro
 - `function`    `__function__` captured by the calling macro
 - `line`        `__LINE__` captured by the calling macro
 - `threadId`    The linux thread id of the caller.
 - `threadName`  The linux thread name of the caller.
 - `message`     The user message.

`timespec` is the actual timestamp used to produce `isoDateTime`. A call to
`localtime_r(&(ts->tv_sec), &tm) == &tm)` is then made, and the UTC offset is
obtained from that.

`sequence` starts at one, and may be used for log consistancy checks.

`logger` is always set to "tinylogger".

`file`, `function` and `line` are obtained from the corresponding pre-processor
macros.

`threadId` is the linux thread id (not the Posix one).

`threadName` is the linux thread name.

`message` is the actual user message.


Example output:
```
{
  "records" : [  {
    "isoDateTime" : "2020-08-11T17:40:31.109019932-04:00",
    "timespec" : {
      "sec" : 1597182031,
      "nsec" : 109019932
    },
    "sequence" : 1,
    "logger" : "tinylogger",
    "level" : "INFO",
    "file" : "json.c",
    "function" : "main",
    "line" : 35,
    "threadId" : 246970,
    "threadName" : "json",
    "message" : "\b backspaces are escaped for JSON output"
  },  {
    "isoDateTime" : "2020-08-11T17:40:31.109213215-04:00",
    "timespec" : {
      "sec" : 1597182031,
      "nsec" : 109213215
    },
    "sequence" : 2,
    "logger" : "tinylogger",
    "level" : "INFO",
    "file" : "json.c",
    "function" : "main",
    "line" : 36,
    "threadId" : 246970,
    "threadName" : "json",
    "message" : "\r carriage returns are escaped for JSON output"
  } ]
}
```

Note: The above example shows escaping for backspaces and carriage returns. The
full list of escaped characters is:
    - backspaces
	- form feeds
	- line feed
	- carriage returns
	- tabs
	- apostrophies
	- backslashes

## Enabling Timezone in the timestamp <a name="enabling-timezone"/>
This feature appends the Olson timezone, as in "Europe/London" or
"America/New_York", not timezone IDs like "EST" or "BST".

Using the timezone allows access to time change history and rough geographic
region that the UTC offset doesn't provide.

Finding the timezone varies depending on Linux distro. And each particular
system may have its configuration modified. And the user can override the
system default by setting the TZ variable in the environment. For these reasons,
supporting timezone must be enabled at compile time.

_If this feature is enabled, the timezone will be appended only if a matching
zoneinfo file in the zoneinfo database directory exists following the rules
used by tzset(3). If it fails to find one, the normal isoDateTime without a
timezone appended will be used. This is done to ensure the timezone used
actually matches the timestamp._

### Verify that this software finds the correct timezone
The program "check-timezone.c" in the demo directory has been provided to
check to see if the timezone can be found by this software. Run it:

```
$ demo/check-timezone
timezone found is America/New_York.
2020-10-16T18:43:47.454282598-04:00
2020-10-16T18:43:47.454282598-04:00[America/New_York]
Fri Oct 16 18:43:47 2020
```
If successfull, the first line displays the timezone found. The second line
displays the normal isoDateTime field (UTC offset, but no timezone). The third
line displays the timestamp with the timezone appended. The fourth line is
formatted by asctime(3).

If it reports a default timezone that meets your expectations, then use of it
can be enabled in the library. Make sure it works on all configurations of your
targets.

### Quick-start configuration
Edit the quick-start/config.h file to enable. There are instructions in that
file.

### autoconf configuration
There is an option to the configure script to enable use of timezones in JSON
output.

```
$ ./configure --enable-timezone
$ make
```
### JSON isoDateTime field with and without timezone

With:
```
    "isoDateTime" : "2020-08-11T17:40:31.109019932-04:00[America/New_York],
```
Without:
```
    "isoDateTime" : "2020-08-11T17:40:31.109019932-04:00",
```
