## Quick Start build

The preferred build method is using the configure script and Makefiles
generated by autotools. But those Makefiles are not intended to be modified,
and can be distracting for those not familiar with autotools.

The quick start build configuration does not rely on autotools.

### setup and build
Running setup.sh copies the needed files from their normal locations and
deposits basic Makefiles in the created subdirectories. Running make in the
quick-start directory will recursively build the logger library and the
examples.

### making the docs
If you have Doxygen installed, the docs can be built with "make docs". Doxygen
will complain a little, as the links in the markdown files will be broken. They
are expecting a different layout. The html output will be available in
doc/html/index.html.

### Proceeding from here...
There is a short description of each example in guide/examples.md. Each example
has more detailed docs in the source code.

There is a list of pre-configured message formats in guide/formats.md
